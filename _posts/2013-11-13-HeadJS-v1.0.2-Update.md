A small path release that fixes a reversion where the no-js class was not removed when js was detected. This was caused by a fix that corrects css classes getting bigger with time under Google Chrome. This patch fixes both issues permanently.

P.S. The HeadJS site has been revamped to be more dynamic and more easily updateable. However i'm not a designer and as far as typographical choices etc go ..the site could use some Designer Luv !

I'd like to keep the current layout (more or less), but typo, color-scheme, ergonomics, and flat design revamps are very welcome.

If you have some Designer Luv to spread ...bring it on !

- Some designs i really love (though maybe overkill ..)
  - [Cassiopeia](http://themes.roussounelosweb.gr/cassiopeia)
  - [Moot](https://moot.it/)
  - And globally the bootstrap style (gray, black, white, or monochromatic with color highlights and large header/footer bars)
